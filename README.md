## Development

### Adding secrets for development

1. Obtain secrets.
2. Add secret files.

```sh
# Add google services files
cp path/to/secrets/google-services/GoogleService-Info.plist ios/Runner/
cp path/to/secrets/google-services/google-services.json android/app/

# Add key.properties files
cp path/to/secrets/android/key.properties android/

# Add keys
cp -r path/to/secrets/keys .
```

3. Update `storeFile` and `uploadStoreFile` properties in `android/key.properties` to location of .jks files.

4. Update `json_key_file` in `android/fastlane/Appfile` (and remove GCP id from file name).

### Running the app

#### VSCode Run and Debug

1. Add launch config with dart-defines to .vscode folder
```sh
cp path/to/secrets/.vscode/launch.json .vscode/
```

2. Run with VSCode Run and debug. 
#### Command line

```sh
flutter doctor
flutter packages get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Run command with dart-define variables from secrets scripts folder
sh path/to/secrets/scripts/flutter_run_android.sh
```

### Running the tests
```sh
flutter doctor
flutter packages get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter test
